#APSSDC Steganography project
Steganography is the practice and art of concealing information within another non-secret medium to prevent detection. The term originates from the Greek words "steganos," meaning "covered" or "hidden," and "graphy," meaning "writing." Unlike cryptography, which focuses on encrypting the content of a message to make it unreadable to unauthorized parties, steganography hides the very existence of the message itself.
